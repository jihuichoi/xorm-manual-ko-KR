### Deleted

Deleted will not really remove one record from table but only tag as deleted via current time. This feature ask you use `xorm:"deleted"`, The field type could be `time.Time`, `type MyTime time.Time` or `int`, `int64`. For example,

```Go
type User struct {
    Id int64
    Name string
    DeletedAt time.Time `xorm:"deleted"`
}
```

When `Delete()` will be called, tag `deleted` will automatically be filled as current time and this record will not be deleted in fact. For example:

```Go
var user User
engine.Id(1).Get(&user)
// SELECT * FROM user WHERE id = ?
engine.Id(1).Delete(&user)
// UPDATE user SET ..., deleted_at = ? WHERE id = ?
engine.Id(1).Get(&user)
// Call Get again, this time it will return false, nil
engine.Id(1).Delete(&user)
// Call delete again, it will return 0, nil
```

But how to get this record if you really need retrieve it? You need `Unscoped`, for example:

```Go
var user User
engine.Id(1).Unscoped().Get(&user)
// Then you will return true, nil
engine.Id(1).Unscoped().Delete(&user)
// Then this record will be really deleted
```
